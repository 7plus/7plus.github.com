The Accessor launcher is a powerful launcher that enables you to quickly reach your goals by using only the keyboard. Here are some of its features:
* Run programs and files. It knows about most installed programs and directly finds them. If it doesn't find a program, just run it manually once and it will be available in Accessor!
* Run URLs or perform web searches in many preconfigured search engines. Accessor imports the bookmarks of all major browsers so they're available at your fingertips!
* Get access to your recently used directories and favorite ones. Simply go in that hard-to-reach, deeply nested directory by opening Accessor and typing its name! Accessor can set the path of open Explorer windows and file dialogs as well.
* Search through stored texts to paste them quickly in the active application!
* Uninstall a program by entering _uninstall ProgramName_!
* Post Twitter or Facebook messages by using an [if this then that](http://www.ifttt.com) recipe!
* Quickly setup a timer to display a message, shutdown the pc and similar things by typing "Message Text in 10mins" or "Shutdown in 1h". Smart text parsing makes it possible to use natural language for the time!
* Advanced result ordering algorithms make sure that Accessor sorts the results by the current context and learns about your mostly used commands to display them at the top of the list!
