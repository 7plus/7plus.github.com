Unlike many other tools and tweaks, 7plus doesn't just focus on a single task but rather targets all kinds of things that help productivity!
Here are some more things you can do with 7plus:
* Use a clipboard manager to paste text you copied before
* Paste text and images on the clipboard as files in Explorer
* Use Tabs in Explorer
* Quickly change the current path with the Numpad keys in Explorer
* Perform mass-rename and replace-in-files in Explorer
* Take screenshots and quickly upload them to FTP or [ImgUr.com](http://www.imgur.com)
* Slide windows out of the screen and activate them again temporarily by moving the mouse to the border
* Quickly change mouse volume and mute with the mouse wheel over the taskbar
* Expand abbreviations that you type
