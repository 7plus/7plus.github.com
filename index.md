# 7plus can
| Automate your tasks        | Act as a launcher           | Improve your workflow      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------  | -------------------------- |
| by combining triggers,     | For opening files and URLs, | with many tools and tweaks |
| conditions and actions to  | navigating to folders,      | for windows, like a clip-  |
| events. Make a hotkey run  | doing web searches, remove  | board manager, Explorer    |
| a program, toggle always   | programs, switching windows | Tabs and window manager    |
| on top for windows, ...    | and much more.              | enhancements.              |

This only provides a very small glimpse at the features of 7plus. Here are some more:

#### Event system
This system allows to combine many different submodules (over 100!) to create the desired behavior.

Here are some examples that show how an event can get executed:
* By pressing a hotkey
* By moving your mouse in a screen corner
* Through file/directory context menu entries created with 7plus
* On a timed schedule
* When a button in the Explorer band bar (Win Vista / 7 only) added by 7plus is clicked
* When a file or directory changes

For each event it's possible to add conditions that limit the execution of the event to a specific context. These include among others:
* Restricting the event to specific active windows or focused controls
* Requiring that a specific file is selected or Explorer is in a specific path
* Restricting the event to an active (non-)fullscreen window
* Requiring that the mouse is over a window or control

An event can execute a list of actions such as:
* Running a program/file/folder/URL
* Showing a message
* Activating/Closing a window
* Sending key or mouse input
* Setting current path or selected files on various windows (such as Explorer)
* Writing text to clipboard or to a file
* Uploading a file to FTP or [ImgUr.com](http://www.imgur.com)
* Trigger an [if this then that](http://www.ifttt.com) recipe
* Send an email
* Take a screenshot
* Shutdown the PC
* Copy/Move/Delete files

#### Accessor launcher
The Accessor launcher is a powerful launcher that enables you to quickly reach your goals by using only the keyboard. Here are some of its features:
* Run programs and files. It knows about most installed programs and directly finds them. If it doesn't find a program, just run it manually once and it will be available in Accessor!
* Run URLs or perform web searches in many preconfigured search engines. Accessor imports the bookmarks of all major browsers so they're available at your fingertips!
* Get access to your recently used directories and favorite ones. Simply go in that hard-to-reach, deeply nested directory by opening Accessor and typing its name! Accessor can set the path of open Explorer windows and file dialogs as well.
* Search through stored texts to paste them quickly in the active application!
* Uninstall a program by entering _uninstall ProgramName_!
* Quickly setup a timer to display a message, shutdown the pc and similar things by typing "Message Text in 10mins" or "Shutdown in 1h". Smart text parsing makes it possible to use natural language for the time!
* Advanced result ordering algorithms make sure that Accessor sorts the results by the current context and learns about your mostly used commands to display them at the top of the list!

#### And many more tools and tweaks for Windows!
Unlike many other tools and tweaks, 7plus doesn't just focus on a single task but rather targets all kinds of things that help productivity!
Here are some more things you can do with 7plus:
* Use a clipboard manager to paste text you copied before
* Paste text and images on the clipboard as files in Explorer
* Use Tabs in Explorer
* Quickly change the current path with the Numpad keys in Explorer
* Perform mass-rename and replace-in-files in Explorer
* Take screenshots and quickly upload them to FTP or [ImgUr.com](http://www.imgur.com)
* Slide windows out of the screen and activate them again temporarily by moving the mouse to the border
* Quickly change mouse volume and mute with the mouse wheel over the taskbar
* Expand abbreviations that you type

Once again, these excerpts only cover a small amount of the things 7plus can do. Why don't you check out some videos?
